## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

1. Find a good prediction model to help bank to know before hand the possibility of a customer leaving their bank.
2. Implement several Supervised Algorithm. 
3. Find best suited machine learning to use for this problem. 


## Results<a name="results"></a>

In this notebook, I am trying to find a good prediction model to help bank to know before hand the possibility of a customer leaving their bank. Bank Churning Model is built to predict possibility of a customer to leave the bank.
